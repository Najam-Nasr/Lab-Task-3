QUESTION NO 1:

The wrong value is calculated merely due to the fact that the number 3000000000 is too large to be stored within the data type int, hence causing an overflow. In C language int have a range of -2147483648 to 2147483647 (Value taken from Google). Since 3000000000 is larger than this, it goes round the whole cycle into negative and that's why our answer is incorrect. To correct this, a bigger data type should be used.
