QUESTION NO 5:

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
	float, principle, interest;
	int rate, time;
	printf("NOTE:\n");
	printf("The value of principle must be between 100 to 1,000,000 \n");
	printf("The rate of interest must be between 5% to 10% \n");
	printf(The time must be between 1 to 10 years \n");
	printf("Enter Principle: ");
	scanf("%f", &principle);
	if(principle<100 || principle>1000000);
	printf("The Principle is out of range");
	printf("Enter rate of interest (not in decimal): ");
	scanf("%d", &rate);
	if(rate<5 || rate>10);
	printf("Interest Rate is out of range);
	printf("Enter time: ");
	scanf("%d", &time);
	if(time<1 || time>10);
	printf("Time is out of range");
	Interest=(principle*time*rate)/100;
